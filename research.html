      <h1>Research Statement</h1>
      <p>
        Proteins evolve at different rates, but the reasons why remain unclear. A common measure of
        evolutionary change is the number of amino acid–altering substitutions (dN), which reflects how
        selection shapes gene function. Many factors—such as sex-biased expression, tissue specificity, and
        gene expression levels—have been suggested as drivers of protein divergence, yet their relative
        importance is not well understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research uses comparative genomics across eight <em>Drosophila</em> species to investigate these
        drivers. By integrating RNA-seq data with features such as codon usage, gene length, chromosomal
        location, protein–protein interaction, and GC content, I aim to build a comprehensive picture of how
        both regulatory and sequence-based features shape molecular evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        To approach this question, I calculate sex bias, tissue specificity (τ), and expression levels from
        RNA-seq data across tissues and species, while also incorporating sequence features like codon
        adaptation index (CAI), GC content, and protein interaction connectivity. Using generalized linear
        models (GLMs), I test how these factors predict amino acid substitution rates (dN). I also apply
        codon-based phylogenetic models in HyPhy to detect adaptive diversification, and the Expression
        Variance and Evolution (EVE) model to assess how expression divergence compares to within-species
        diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining expression-based and sequence-based features, my work aims to disentangle the forces
        shaping protein divergence. This integrative approach will provide new insight into how gene
        regulation and selective pressures interact to generate molecular diversity across species.
